# hello-me
it's my second time to github,last time i didn't hang on it,i gave up,i hope this time can be some differences.
i really appreaciate to see zouquan's gains in 2017,i want to be same as him, or better, i want to have a try,i'm really upset of me current situations, but it doesn't matter, because i know i have to let me go,i dont't want to give pressure again on me ,and i dont want to get pressure from anyone else,i  just want to study and be better,no more competition,i just want to keep peaceful in my heart,i like it, and i'm really appreaciatee to type on my keyboard now.
